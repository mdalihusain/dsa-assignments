Question 1
What is the time complexity T(n) for the following code snippet?
a = 1
b = 1
while(b <= n)
{
    a += 1
    b += 1
    cout<<"Hi";
}

ANSWER = 
As given here (b += 1) => O(n)
As given in lecture yesterday, (b += a) => O(n^2)

Question 2
Write the output for the following recursive code snippet for n = 3:
void fun(int n)
{
    if(n > 0)
    {
        cout<<n:
        fun(n - 1);
        cout<<n;
    }
}

ANSWER =
